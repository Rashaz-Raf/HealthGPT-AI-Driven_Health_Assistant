# HealthGPT-AI-Driven_Health_Assistant
HealthGPT is an intelligent chatbot designed to assist users with health-related queries, leveraging the power of Generative AI and large language models (LLMs). The chatbot provides personalized responses to users' questions about medical conditions, symptoms, and drug prescriptions. It analyzes user inputs and offers insights, serving as a virtual health assistant.

The project integrates data processing and natural language understanding with a robust backend powered by Hugging Face transformers. Key features include:
1. **Data Analysis and Cleaning:** Processes drug-related datasets to understand conditions, reviews, and ratings.
2. **Interactive Query Handling:** Users can ask diverse, open-ended questions about health and receive contextual, precise answers.
3. **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzes user reviews of drugs to determine overall sentiments and effectiveness.
4. **Health Condition Insights:** Provides insights into common health conditions and their associated treatments.
5. **Personalized Responses:** Uses pre-trained language models to generate tailored answers.

This project showcases a combination of machine learning, natural language processing, and interactive UI design to make healthcare information more accessible.
